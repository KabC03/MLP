- print statement seems to change output and prevent loss diverging?
- Network seems to work but you have to mess with activation functions and scaling a lot
- Error is very high but patterns are correct
- Mysterious NAN values sometimes when using tan, ln, etc

- Try model a 2D function
- Try classification on an image
- Thread functions
